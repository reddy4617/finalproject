# finalproject

***************Note*****************
I just saw that i uploaded the previous version of my project, 
you can see everythings is same, but mistakenly upload that project folder, because name was same,

You can check even that one is working accurately, 

Actually I was implementing the design patterns one by one and save the project copies accordingly, So please I request you you can check that even in old file everything is working, 
and it was an honest mistake that i uploaded the wrong file.. 

Please consider the latest one. Thank you

 I implemented the Iterator design pattern, Observer design pattern, Command design pattern, Factory Design pattern and Abstract factory design pattern.
I used the Abstract factory design with the factory design pattern thatâ€™s why I created only 1 package for both of them.
